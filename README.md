# SageMaker Example Notebooks Testing

A continuous integration (CI) system for Jupyter notebooks, built using Amazon SageMaker.

## :books: Background

[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is a fully managed service for data science and machine learning (ML) workflows.
You can use Amazon SageMaker to simplify the process of building, training, and deploying ML models.

The [SageMaker example notebooks](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the usage of Amazon SageMaker.

This **SageMaker Example Notebooks Testing** repository contains the code for the open-source CI system for the example notebooks.
It can be repurposed to build a CI system for your own Jupyter notebooks on SageMaker.
